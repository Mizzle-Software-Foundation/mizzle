# Mizzle
The compiler/interpreter for the mizzle programming language. Mizzle. Drizzle now. Thunder later.

# Info
Mizzle is not complete. The dev guide is being worked on. Stay tuned for more mizzle.

# Run the test file
After downloading the latest dev release, use this command: `python mizzle.py`,

in the root directory of this project, with python installed.

It will ask you for a path to a mizzle file.

Just enter the path to the test file. e.g. `path\to\test\file\mizzle\test.mz`.
